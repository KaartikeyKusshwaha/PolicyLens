According to Policy 1, transactions above USD 50,000 require enhanced due diligence, which has not been performed. Additionally, Policy 2 explicitly prohibits transactions involving sanctioned jurisdictions without explicit regulatory approval. The similarity to Case 1, which involved a large transaction to a high-risk jurisdiction without proper documentation, further supports flagging this transaction. Therefore, it is necessary to flag this transaction for further review.",
