Although the amount is below the enhanced due diligence threshold of USD 50,000, it still warrants further review due to its proximity to the higher threshold. Additionally, the sender and receiver are entities from different jurisdictions, which may require additional scrutiny. Furthermore, the transaction description is a standard international wire transfer, but it lacks specific details about the purpose or nature of the transaction, which could be a red flag. This is similar to Case 1 (TXN_DEMO_001), where a large transaction to a high-risk jurisdiction was flagged without proper documentation. Therefore, this transaction should be flagged for further review.",
