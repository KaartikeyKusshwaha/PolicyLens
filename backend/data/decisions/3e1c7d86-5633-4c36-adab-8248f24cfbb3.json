    "risk_score": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "This transaction is flagged due to its high value (USD 5000.0) and the fact that it involves an international wire transfer. According to Policy 1, transactions exceeding USD 10,000 must be reported to the compliance team within 24 hours. Although the transaction amount is below the enhanced due diligence threshold of USD 50,000, it still warrants further review. Additionally, the transaction involves a UK-based entity (Global Trading Ltd), which may require additional scrutiny. Furthermore, the similarity with Case 1 (TXN_DEMO_001) is high (0.91), where a large transaction to a high-risk jurisdiction was flagged without proper documentation. Therefore, this transaction requires a thorough review to ensure compliance with AML/KYC regulations.",
